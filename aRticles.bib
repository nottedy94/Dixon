  title={Laetiporus sulphureus}, 
  url={https://www.mushroomexpert.com/laetiporus_sulphureus.html}, 
  abstractNote={Laetiporus sulphureus, often called the “chicken of the woods,” appears in eastern North America’s hardwood forests, where it causes a brown heart rot in the wood of standing and fallen oaks and other hardwoods. Since it is a heart rot fungus, the mushrooms appear above ground (often high on the tree)—or in a position that would have been above ground before the trunk fell. Distinctive physical features for Laetiporus sulphureus include its yellow-orange colors and the fact that it usually grows in overlapping, shelving clusters. Its flesh is soft (for a polypore), and its pore surface is yellow—although a white-pored version also exists (see below). In western North America there are several similar species (see the key to Laetiporus) and, in eastern North America the similar Laetiporus huroniensis appears on conifer wood. Laetiporus cincinnatus also appears in eastern hardwood forests, but is a root and butt rot fungus and therefore usually appears at the butt of the tree or on the ground near its base; additionally, Laetiporus cincinnatus grows in rosettes and has pinkish orange colors, a whitish pore surface, and smaller spores.A white-pored Laetiporus sulphureus, distinct from Laetiporus cincinnatus, is sometimes reported; Linder and Banik (2008) found some DNA support for the separation of a white-pored species or variety, but cautioned that further research is needed.Since the chicken of the woods is often a parasite, there is a good chance that it has killed its host tree. However, the mushrooms do not appear until well after the fungus—in the form of mushroom-less mycelium—has attacked the tree. By the time the chickens appear, they are definitely coming home to roost, as far as the tree’s health is concerned, and the fungus cannot be “removed” by removing the mushrooms.According to mating and DNA studies (Banik et al 2010, Song & Cui 2017) there are actually at least two candidates for the true Laetiporus sulphureus: one is limited to Europe and appears on the wood of hardwoods or conifers, while the other is distributed in Europe, North America, and South America and is limited to hardwoods. The two species, though well defined, are apparently morphologically inseparable, at least on current data. Since Laetiporus sulphureus was originally named from France (by Bulliard, who called it “the sulphur bolete,” in 1780) the species will have to be redefined in a contemporary sense on the basis of French collections and, if the Europe-only species is selected, our North American species will need a name.},

  abstractNote={Galax (Galax urceolata) is an evergreen groundcover harvested for use in the floral industry. The plants durable, shiny green leaves turn red in the fall and are popular background foliage in floral arrangements. People living in the mountains of North Carolina and other rural Appalachian locations have harvested (pulled) galax to supplement their incomes since before the 20th century; however, over the last decade, Hispanic laborers have largely displaced local harvesters. Today, more than 90 percent of the harvesters are of Hispanic origin. An experienced harvester can pull approximately 5,000 leaves a day; the value of this amount can range from $20 to $120. Prices vary depending on the season, the size and color of the leaves, and market demand. Industry concern for the availability or sustainability of galax has prompted the USDA Forest Service to restrict the harvest season. Since 2001, no harvesting is allowed from May 1 through June 15 when new leaves are emerging. The USDA Forest Service and the National Park Service are both conducting research to determine sustainable harvest levels.},

  abstractNote={The hardiest and most adaptable of the southern pines, Pinus echinata (Shortleaf Pine) is a large evergreen conifer with short, spreading branches forming a pyramidal crown which broadens with age. Its evergreen foliage of relatively short bright green needles, 5 in. (12 cm), is borne in groups of two. The cylindrical brown cones, 1.5-2.5 in. long (3-6 cm), are produced on mature specimen (over 20 years old). Shortleaf Pine seeds are an important food source for birds and small mammals. The thin, flaky, black bark becomes reddish brown with evident resin pockets on older specimens. Shortleaf Pine is the most widely distributed of the southern yellow pines, being present in 21 states. It is a pioneer species. Many Shortleaf Pine stands became established after the Civil War when fields were abandoned. An important timber species, it is fire-resistant and very drought-tolerant. Perfect for native plant gardens or naturalized areas.},
